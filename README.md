## 🌟 Features

### 🛡️ Core Protection & Privacy

* **IP Grabbing & Geolocation:** Instantly displays your partner's IP address, Country, Region, City, and ISP.
* **VPN/Relay Detection:** Automatically detects and warns you if a partner is using a Proxy or Turn Server (Relay IP).
* **Report Protection:** Intercepts WebSocket signals to block "Report" or "Ban" attempts from reaching the server. Includes an audio alert ("Report Detected").
* **Face Detection Bypass:** Tricks site algorithms into thinking a real face is visible, preventing "Black Screen" bans.
* **Anti-Bot & Fingerprint Spoofing:**
* Spoofs Navigator properties (UserAgent, Hardware Concurrency, Device Memory).
* Bypasses automated "human verification" checks (Variance tests, Scroll length).



### 🚫 Blocking & Automation

* **Country Blocker:** Automatically skip partners from specific countries. Includes a visual continent map selector.
* **IP Blocker:** Permanently block specific IPs. If you match with them again, the script auto-skips immediately.
* **Auto-Skip Logic:** Smart skipping algorithms for Ome.tv, OmegleApp, Umingle, and more.
* **Disconnect Monitor:** Automatically finds a new partner if the current one disconnects (Specific support for OmegleApp & OmegleWeb).

### 🎬 Media & Hardware Manipulation

* **Fake Camera:** Replace your webcam feed with a custom video loop (supports `.mp4` URLs).
* **Anti-Ban Jitter:** Adds subtle movement/noise to static video feeds to prevent "Static Image" bans.
* **Device Spoofing:** Renames your hardware inputs in the browser (e.g., renames "Default Cam" to "Logitech C920").
* **Raw Audio Mode:** Disables echo cancellation and noise suppression for high-fidelity audio processing.
* **Thumbnail Capture:** Automatically captures and saves a screenshot of your partner's video stream after connection.

### 🛠️ Advanced Tools & UI

* **Draggable & Resizable UI:** A modern, dark-themed interface that can be moved, resized, or minimized.
* **Ghost Mode:** Makes the interface transparent to monitor stats without obstructing the view.
* **Map Integration:** Open a Google Maps window (Standard or Street View) centered on your partner's location.
* **Notes & History:** Keep a history of IPs encountered, save custom notes for specific users, and view past thumbnails.
* **Element Selector:** Visually select and hide (or blackout) annoying website elements (ads, banners, watermarks).
* **Developer Console:** Built-in log window to view raw WebRTC connection data and API errors.

## 🔧 Recommended Browser Settings

To ensure all features (especially IP Grabbing and Fake Camera) work correctly, please configure your browser as follows:

1. **WebRTC must be ENABLED:**
* Do *not* use extensions like "WebRTC Control" or "Disable WebRTC" that completely block IP leakage. This script *needs* to read the WebRTC candidates to fetch the IP.
* If you use a VPN, ensure it allows WebRTC traffic (Split Tunneling might be required if the VPN blocks P2P).


2. **Autoplay Permissions:**
* Allow the site to Autoplay video and audio. This ensures the "Fake Camera" video loads and plays correctly without user interaction.


3. **Ad Blockers:**
* Some aggressive ad blockers may interfere with the IP geolocation API (`ipwho.is`). If stats say "Net Error," try whitelisting the chat site or the API domain.


4. **Hardware Acceleration:**
* For the best performance with the "Anti-Ban Jitter" and "Fake Camera" overlays, ensure Hardware Acceleration is enabled in your browser settings.
